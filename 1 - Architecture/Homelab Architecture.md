# What are my goals and what do i want to create with my homelab ?

> This is where everything start.

Firstly, i have to plan what homelab i want to create. This plan can of course evolve afterward if i have new ideas on what to implement or new tools that could be cool to add. 
For now i want to create a realistic infrastructure of a small company of ~20 employees.

Sadly i do not have the hardware to create my full homelab in real life. So i will virtualize everything.
