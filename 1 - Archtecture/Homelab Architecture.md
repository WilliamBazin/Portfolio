#start 

This is where everything start.
Firstly, i ave to plan what homelab i want to create. This plan can of course evolve afterward if i have new ideas on what to implement or new tools that could be cool to add. 

Actually i do not have the hardware to create my full homelab. So i will virtualize everything. This can be a future project
