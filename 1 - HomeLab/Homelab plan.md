# HomeLab Project

> This is where everything start.

## Introduction

A homelab is practical. You can be inventive, try new technologies, test vulnerabilities... Its a great tool to have with you as a cybersecurity worker. 

Since I don't have the physical hardware to create a full-scale lab, I'll be virtualizing the entire environment. This approach allows me to be flexible and expand the setup as new ideas, tools, or technologies emerge.
